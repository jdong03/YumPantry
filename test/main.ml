       Test Plan Explanation:

       Our testing strategy encompassed both black box and glass box testing
       methods to ensure comprehensive coverage of the system's functionality.
       This approach allowed us to test the system from an external perspective
       (black box) and also use the internal logic (glass box) for more thorough
       testing.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Modules Tested with OUnit:

       - Quantity: We developed a series of tests to verify the functionality of
                   quantity conversions, comparisons, and operations like addition,
                   subtraction, scaling, etc. These tests were designed to handle
                   various edge cases and ensure the robustness of the quantity
                   operations.
       - Pantry:   The Pantry module was tested to ensure proper management of
                   ingredients, including adding, removing, finding, checking
                   quantities, the number of distinct ingredients, displaying the
                   pantry, and resetting the pantry. Special attention was given to
                   edge cases like handling empty pantries or removing more
                   ingredients than available.
       - Ingredient: We created tests for the Ingredient module's of_string
                    function to verify the functionality of our autocorrecting 
                    algorithm and the correctness of matching a string to an Ingredient.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Test Case Development:

       - Quantity: For Quantity tests, we used a combination of glass box and black
                   box techniques. Glass box testing was utilized to ensure
                   coverage of all code paths, especially for functions with
                   multiple branches. Black box testing was employed to test the
                   system from the user's perspective, without considering the
                   internal implementation.
       - Pantry:   Pantry tests primarily utilized black box testing, focusing on
                   the user's interaction with the pantry system, such as adding
                   and removing ingredients, and checking for specific quantities.
                   After completing the functions, we wrote additional tests to
                   ensure that edge cases were handled properly and that we were
                   achieving branch coverage.
       - Ingredient: Ingredient tests primarily utilized black box testing,
                     focusing on the autocorrect feature of the of_string function.
                     Although we needed to know the general autocorrect algorithm
                     used, black box testing was used from there to verify the
                     correctness of the implementation Levenshtein distance
                     calculations.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Omitted Unit Tests:

       - Certain complex integration scenarios involving simultaneous interactions
         between multiple modules were not extensively tested due to time
         constraints. However, individual module tests provide a high level of
         confidence in the system's reliability.

       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Command Line and GUI Testing:

       - In addition to OUnit tests, we manually tested the system by running the
         command line interface and GUI. This allowed us to test the system from
         the user's perspective and ensure that the system was functioning as
         expected.
       - For the CLI, direct user simulation was employed, where typical user
         commands were inputted to observe the systemâ€™s responses, alongside
         scripted test cases for automated scenario testing. This provided a
         technical perspective on user experience.
       - The GUI testing involved manual user interaction, such as clicking buttons
         and entering data, focusing on usability aspects like intuitiveness and
         responsiveness of the interface.
       - We utilized both black and glass box testing methods for the CLI and GUI.
         Black box testing was used to test the system from the user's perspective,
         without considering the internal implementation. Glass box testing was
         employed to ensure coverage of all code paths, especially for functions
         with multiple branches.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Justification for Correctness:

       - The extensive test cases developed for each module along with the
         thourough Command Line and GUI Testing, covering a wide range of
         scenarios and edge cases, provide strong evidence for the system's
         correctness. The combination of black box and glass box testing methods
         ensures that both the external behavior and internal logic of the
         system are sound and reliable.
